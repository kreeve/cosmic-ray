Mutation testing is conceptually simple and elegant. You make certain
kinds of controlled changes (mutations) to your code, and then you run
your test suite over this mutated code. If your test suite fails, then
we say that your tests "killed" (i.e. detected) the mutant. If the
changes cause your code to simply crash, then we say the mutant is
"incompetent". If your test suite passes, however, we say that the
mutant has "survived".

Needless to say, we want to kill all of the mutants.

The goal of mutation testing is to verify that your test suite is
actually testing all of the parts of your code that it needs to, and
that it is doing so in a meaningful way. If a mutant survives your test
suite, this is an indication that your test suite is not adequately
checking the code that was changed. This means that either a) you need
more or better tests or b) you've got code which you don't need.

You can read more about mutation testing at `the repository of all human
knowledge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing>`__. Lionel
Brian has a `nice set of
slides <http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF4290/v10/undervisningsmateriale/INF4290-Mutest.pdf>`__
introducing mutation testing as well.
